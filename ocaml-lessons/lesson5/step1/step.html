<h3>Sequence of expressions</h3>

<p>It is easy to get confused by OCaml syntax since it's different from
mainstream languages. So you'd better be aware of a few things before digging
any deeper.</p>

<br />
<p>To begin with, you should know that a proper command must normally ends with
<em>';;'</em> to be processed by the top-level.  This tutorial automatically adds
the double semicolon as soon as you hit enter but the normal top-level won't.
The double semicolon is only required when interacting with the top level
interpreter and as such is not part of OCaml syntax.</p>

<br />
<p>What <em>is</em> part of OCaml syntax, though, is the simple semicolon
<em>';'</em> which is commonly used as an expression terminator, except that in
OCaml it's a <b>separator</b>.  In other words, you must not write <code>expr1;
expr2;</code> but <code>expr1 ; expr2</code>.</p>

<br/ >
<p>You may now enter <code>next ()</code> to check your understanding.</p>
