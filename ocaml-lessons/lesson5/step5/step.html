<h3>Parentheses</h3>

<p>With regard to grouping expression or enforcing order of evaluation,
OCaml syntax is surprisingly easy: you can use pervasively either parentheses
of <em>begin</em>/<em>end</em> keywords.</p>
<br />
<p>Example grouping expressions in an <em>if</em> form:</p>
<pre><code>if 1+2 = 3 then (
  print_string "did you knew that?\n" ;
  print_string "amazing!\n"
)
</code></pre>

<p>Or forcing order of evaluation with <em>begin</em>/<em>end</em> (although
you won't find this often!):</p>
<code>begin 1 + 2 end * 3</code>

<br /><br />
<p>Also, as function application takes precedence over infix operators you will
frequently uses parentheses to make explicit the expected evaluation order, as
in: <code>square (1 + 1)</code> since <code>square 1+1</code> would yield
<em>2</em>.

<p>Enter <code>next ()</code> when you are ready to practice.</p>
